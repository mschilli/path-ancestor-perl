NAME
    Path::Ancestor - Find the longest common ancestor of N paths

SYNOPSIS
        use Path::Ancestor qw(longest_common_ancestor);

        my $ancestor = longest_common_ancestor( 
                         "/foo/bar/baz",
                         "/foo/bar/baz/moo",
                         "/foo/bar/quack" 
                       );

        # => "foo/bar"

DESCRIPTION
    Path::Ancestor finds the longest common ancestor of N file paths.

    Make sure that all paths are given in the same format (either all
    absolute or all relative), Path::Ancestor won't do anything fancy to
    convert them. Also, the paths given need to be canonical, because
    Path::Ancestor won't clean them up or interpret them in terms of a file
    system -- it is just a string processor.
